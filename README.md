# LinearRegression_GradientDescent
This project implements linear regression and uses an optimization technique called the 'Gradient Descent' to establish a relationship between student test scores and the amount of hours studied.

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. 
The goal is to find a linear equation that best represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
### A simple linear regression is represented as,
y = mx + b 
### Which is inhand the slope equation.

## Gradient Descent
When training a machine learning model, we aim to find the best parameters (coefficients) that minimize the cost function (or loss function). 
Since direct computation of the minimum is often infeasible for large datasets, Gradient Descent provides an efficient way to reach the optimal solution iteratively.
